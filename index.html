        <p class="hover-text1">I was on the train, heading home after a long day, when I noticed a guy across 
            from me slowly nodding off. His head dipped forward as he fought the pull of 
            sleep, but eventually, he gave in. His eyes closed, and his body relaxed into 
            the rhythm of the train. It was one of those everyday moments you almost miss 
            if you’re not paying attention.</p>
        <p class="hover-text2">As I watched him sleep, I started thinking about how transit isn’t just 
            about getting from point A to point B. It’s a space where life unfolds—where 
            people find a moment to rest, to recharge, even if just for a few stops. The 
            train, with its steady motion and soft hum, became a temporary refuge, a place 
            where the city’s chaos quiets down just enough to allow a weary passenger to 
            catch some rest.</p>
        <p class="hover-text3">It made me realize that transit is more than just a means of 
            transportation—it’s a reflection of the city itself. It’s where we see the 
            vulnerability of others, where we’re reminded of our shared humanity. Whether 
            we’re rushing to work, heading home, or dozing off for a few precious minutes, 
            the train is where we all come together. It’s a place where the city’s energy is 
            channeled, where our paths cross in ways we don’t always expect.</p>
        <p class="hover-text4">Seeing that guy asleep on the train was a reminder that, even in the constant 
            motion of city life, there are moments of stillness. In those moments, we find 
            a connection to the transit that carries us through our day, and maybe even a 
            connection to the people we share that journey with.</p>
